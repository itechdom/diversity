# Alternative Curricula Based on Experimentation and Fundamentals
To create a curriculum that emphasizes understanding the fundamentals of each field through experimentation and the scientific method, we can design an educational pathway that begins with core principles and progressively allows for specialization. This approach encourages students to explore connections between disciplines and leverage our knowledge graph (KFlow) for discovering new knowledge and interdisciplinary fields. Below are some proposed curricula structures:

## Core Foundations Curriculum
